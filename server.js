 Module dependencies:

 - Express
 - Http (to run Express)
 - Underscore (because it's cool)
 - Socket.IO

 It is a common practice to name the variables after the module name.
 Ex: http is the "http" module, express is the "express" module, etc.
 The only exception is Underscore, where we use, conveniently, an
 underscore. Oh, and "socket.io" is simply called io. Seriously, the
 rest should be named after its module name.
